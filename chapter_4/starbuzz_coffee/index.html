    <!-- Best practice - Use full URLS for links outside your site -->
    <!-- Best practice - Use relative paths for pages within your website -->
    <!-- Top tip - Keep your link labels concise. Don’t make entire sentences or large pieces of text into links. In general, keep them to a few words. Provide additional information in the title attribute.-->
    <!-- Top tip - Keep your link labels meaningful. Never use link labels like “click here” or “this page.” Users tend to scan pages for links first, and then read pages second. So, providing meaningful links improves the usability of your page. Test your page by reading just the links on it; do they make sense? Or do you need to read the text around them?  -->
    <!-- Top tip - Avoid placing links right next to each other; users have trouble distinguishing between links that are placed closely together. -->

    <!-- Linking to a specific part of the page can be done with using an id attribute on the element -->
    <!-- So in the above, notice the #Coffee at the end of the href. When I load the web page, this takes me to the element with the id "Coffee" -->
    <!-- See page 151 for more information -->

If you don’t tell the browser a specific window to use, the browser just opens the page in the same window. You can tell the browser to use a different window by adding a target attribute to the <a> element. The value of the target attribute tells the browser the
“target window” for the page. If you use “_blank” for the target, the browser will always open a new window to display the page. Let’s take a closer look: -->
