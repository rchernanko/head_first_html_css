    <h1>Chapter 6 - Getting serious with HTML</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You should alawys tell the browser which version of HTML you are using...
        </li>
        <li>
            You can tell the browser which version of HTML you're using with a doctype. It’s a little bit of markup you can use that goes at the very top of your HTML file.
        </li>
        <li>
            By using a doctype, the browser is able to be more precise in the way it interprets and renders your pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            In HTML5, it's just this... <code>!doctype html</code>, but with an opening and closing bracket...
            <!-- Figure out how to display doctype in plain text -->
        </li>
        <li>
            When the browser sees the above, it assumes you’re using standard HTML.
        </li>
        <li>
            Going forward, rather than continue to crank out version 6, 7, 8 of HTML, the standards guys have turned the specification into a living standard that will document the technology as it evolves. So, no more version numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can write DOCTYPE or doctype. Both work.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>An example:
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="images/doctype_example.png" alt="Example of the usage of doctype" width="596" height="226" />
    </p>

    <p>
        HTML5 is not just for making web pages anymore; it's designed for making full-blown web applications. </p>
    <p>
